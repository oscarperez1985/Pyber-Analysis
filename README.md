# PyBer-Analysis

## Overview

In this module, the *Python's Pandas* and *Python's Matplotlib* libraries are used to process, analyze and visualize PyBer's ride-sharing data.

Two input csv datasets are provided for its analysis:
1.Ride-sharing information by city, **[city data](./Resources/city_data.csv)**.

The objectives are to showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders as well as the percentage of total fares, riders and drivers for each type of city. The results being produced will help PyBer improve the acces to ride-sharing services and assess the affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

The **[analysis jupyter notebook](./PyBer_Challenge.ipynb)** along with the following three final deliverables are provided:

- **[Deliverable 1](./analysis/Deliverable1_SummaryDF.jpg)**: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type.
- **[Deliverable 2](./analysis/Deliverable2_LineChart.jpg)**: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type.
- **Deliverable 3**: A written report for the PyBer analysis (This README.md file).

## Results

### **Deliverable 1: Ride-sharing Summary DataFrame by City**

The first step to generate the ride-sharing summary dataframe by city consisted in merging the two input tables. The merged
